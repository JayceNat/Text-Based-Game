It's really cold in here, and the whole shed seems flimsy in the wind.
It keeps shifting slightly from side to side and making unsettling noises with each gust.</initdr>

    <initdr>You walk over to your driveway in the moonlight.

Very quickly you notice the hood of your car is open, and the battery is missing...
You start wondering if Henry did that... And if so, why?

The walk to town is about 2 miles North.

The wind picks up suddenly and...

... Wait... It almost sounds like someone is stomping around in the grove of trees behind your house.</initdr>
    <gendr>You're standing outside your house on the moonlit driveway.</gendr>

          <docx>The paper has a big, bold title running across the front page: "TWELVE MISSING - SEARCH CONTINUES"

	The paper says: 

		"The number of missing Ashbury residents has reached an all time high of 12 today.
	'The search has been unsuccessful thus far,' says deputy chief Hockstetter, 
	'We don't have any leads, and the majority of the residents won't talk sense with us. 
	Most claim they saw demons taking people... what ridiculousness! 
	Though rest assured, we are doing everything in our power to bring 
	each and every missing person home unharmed.'

	With the number of missing persons on the rise, many refuse to leave their homes after sunset.
	There seems to be a town-wide panic ensuing around these superstitions and speculations."
