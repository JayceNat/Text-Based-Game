	"Lucy,

		This is just to say that I'll always love you.
	I miss you more than I can bear. I have a hard time going home these days, 
	knowing you won't be there. The police have all given up on finding you.
	They seem far more concerned with the people who went missing after you did.
	I don't feel anger so much anymore... It's mostly just sadness now.

		Everyone is convinced of some frightening beast that keeps swooping our loved ones away,
	stealing them from us in the night. I just can't believe all that.
	But I just don't seem to care any longer. All I feel is emptiness, there is nothing 
	for me now but the memory of you.
		I'm leaving my wedding ring here, on our boulder. The one we sat on together 
	that night, so many years ago, when I asked you to marry me.
	When you were staring up at the stars and I was staring at you.
	And I knew that when you looked down from those stars, you'd be looking at me.

		I hope you're in those stars now, looking down at me still.
	I'll see you soon. I just hope the river isn't too cold."

 	Nothing can prevent the fate that this entire town will face. We will all be consumed.
	DEVOURED by this wretched THING!

	It continues: 

	"I've made a discovery. 
	The beast can be warded temporarily with symbols or items resembling snakes.
	Confirming it seemed lunacy to me at the time, but it did in fact work!

	I'd fashioned a snake bangle and worn it into the woods. I heard the stomping.
	The monster appeared, and went down on all fours in pursuit of me... 
	I was terrified. But as it got closer to me, it veered off in the other direction.
	I was fifteen feet from that creature, and I survived... Perhaps ~~"

	Not only are they incredibly strong and merciless, but their diet consists entirely of human flesh.
	They are known to hunt at night, and are believed to hunt alone, as Ghouls have never been seen in groups.

    <initdr>You've entered the forest on the West side of the road between your house and town.
It' so incredibly dark in the thick trees, but luckily you have a flashlight.

You keep on walking between the trees and through the fallen branches that cover the ground.
You can't fight off the feeling that you're being watched... 

. . . . . . .

You finally make it to an opening in the trees, and you walk out of the forest
onto the sandy bank of the moonlit Forest Lake.</initdr>

    <initdr>You followed the shoreline of the lake until you reached the Collapsed Lakeside Tent. 
It seems like it hasn't been here very long, almost like it was abandoned in a hurry.

The front door flap is wide open, and just the rear portion of the tent is collapsed.
Shining the flashlight into the tent reveals some pillows
and sleeping bags that appear to have been left behind... 

... Is that... blood in the back of the collapsed tent?</initdr>

    <initdr>You wander from the moonlit road into the dark forest to the East...
As soon as you pass the first row of trees, you feel engulfed by the darkness.
You begin to feel convinced that, if it weren't for your flashlight, 
you'd become dinner for some creature in these woods. 

You hear the wind creaking and bending the trees, and to the South you're pretty positive
that occasionally you can faintly hear that stomping sound you'd heard out behind your house...

But you keep on trekking through the trees; their tops swaying insanely to the song of the wind,
and their trunks staying perfectly still - as though nothing could move them at all.</initdr>
    <gendr>You're standing in the forest, East of the road between your house and town.
It's really dark here, and you almost feel hunted.</gendr>

	The paper says: 

		"The number of missing Ashbury residents has reached an all time high of 12 today.
	'The search has been unsuccessful thus far,' says deputy chief Hockstetter, 
	'We don't have any leads, and the majority of the residents won't talk sense with us. 
	Most claim they saw demons taking people... what ridiculousness! 
	Though rest assured, we are doing everything in our power to bring 
	each and every missing person home unharmed.'

	With the number of missing persons on the rise, many refuse to leave their homes after sunset.
	There seems to be a town-wide panic ensuing around these superstitions and speculations.
	Residents are reminded that Ashbury has put a curfew into effect, and all townspeople
	will need to use their previously distributed keys to enter the town gates after dark."

    <initdr>You kept walking East, and you've made it out of the forest 
into a small clearing about the size of a football field.

You're standing at the South end of it, and to the North the grade slopes down
enough that you can see the top of some of the vast forest.

You can see the moon again, and you're beginning to feel comforted by it.
It bathes your surroundings with enough light that you know where you are.
You almost don't want to go into the forest again... 
You feel like it's making you crazy just to be walking in there this late at night.

... And you're pretty sure that stomping sound you were hearing was getting closer.</initdr>

    <initdr>You go North, still in the clearing. You're grateful for the moonlight. 
You notice that you aren't walking nearly as quickly as you were in the forest.
It's almost like the wall of trees surrounding you create a safe-haven,
and the yellow-white light of the moon acts as a ward against the fear setting into you.

You almost want to smile, in fact. But you don't, because you know that to get out of here
you're going to have to go back into the forest................ Wait........
......... Is that the stomping sound again?

You turn around and look in the direction of the sound, by where you came into the clearing.
You see a white looking thing, very briefly, before it dashes back into the trees...

It almost looked like a person, but... bigger?
You notice your hands are shaking from fear and adrenaline... You need to get out of here.</initdr>

		In consideration of the recent missing persons as well as the well-being of all townspeople,
		Mayor Finch has put a full curfew and town-wide lockdown into effect.

		The curfew will be strictly enforced each night beginning at sundown, and all gated entrances into
		the town will be shut. Each resident will be given a key to the gate nearest their home,
		but it is vehemently advised that everybody remain in the confines of the town after sunset.

		Mayor Finch does not encourage or promote the recent hysteria or speculations of demons or wild beasts.
		It is important to note that the lockdown and curfew have been put into effect specifically to ease
		the minds of all Ashbury residents, as many have requested this be enforced."

    <nom>Ashbury - South Entrance</nom>

    <initdr>After some time (and jogging), you approach the South entrance of Ashbury.
It looks barricaded, and the South town gate is shut...

This entrance to town has been sealed off.
Through the South gate you can easily tell that the whole town is dark,
the power is out here also.
It's completely silent, aside from the gusts of wind.

You see a bulletin board near the gate with a box full of papers that says: 
"Ashbury Residents - Please Read."</initdr>
    <gendr>You're standing just outside the South Gate of Ashbury.
The whole town is dark...</gendr>

    <initdr>You make your way through the South gate, and you're standing in the South Square.
The town looks ghostly to you with all the power out... Almost like no one has ever even lived here.

Being inside the town walls makes you finally feel very safe and secure.
You are starting to feel convinced that there really is some beast out there...
And that perhaps you glimpsed it... ever so briefly.

You really need to get to Henry's.</initdr>
    <gendr>You're in the South Square of Ashbury.
